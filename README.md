# this has become a general purpose dump for random things I've fiddled with on and off - nothing even useful here

## General Machine Learning Stuff

If this ever becomes useful I'll make a real readme. As it stands there is only two folders:

- **lague_NN** which contains the code from Sebastian Lague's (sadly discontinued) YouTube series titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVQUSndDllU&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0frsCrmv4fKfZ2OQIwoUuYO">Neural Networks</a> 
which covered building and training a simple neural network using MNist data (included)
- **other_example_based_on_lague** which contains a cloned repository from <a href="https://github.com/matthijsdewit111">matthijsdewit111</a>. It is
another neural network which uses the Sebastian Lague code as a starting point, and adds a bunch to it which is well annotated.


# More Cool Shit Will Be Here Soonish
